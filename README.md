Auxilliary functions to make R code more declarative 

# Introduction
R code can quickly become very complex. Various packages have been developed so simplify R code, such as the (maggrittR)[https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/magrittr/vignettes/magrittr.html] package and the (wrapr)[https://github.com/WinVector/wrapr] package. 

These packages introduce novel operators to simplify R code. MagrittR for example introduces the `%>%`-piping operator, which can greatly simplify code.
