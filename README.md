# declarativeR
Auxilliary functions to make R code more declarative 

# Introduction
Code written in *R* can quickly become very complex. Unsurprisingly, various great packages have been developed to simplify R code, such as [magrittR](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/magrittr/vignettes/magrittr.html) and  [wrapr](https://github.com/WinVector/wrapr). These packages add new, custom operators to the R language that can make complex code a lot more readable. 

Take *MagrittR* for example. Their `%>%` operator is extremely helpfull when writing long chains of operators. Compare the following two examples: 

<table>
<tr>
    <td>Regular R<td>
    <td>MagrittR<td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>test<td>
    <td>test<td>
</tr>



</table>
